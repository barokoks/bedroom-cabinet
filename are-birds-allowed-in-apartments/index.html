Are Birds Allowed in Apartments (&#43;Best Type to Own) From birdspundit.com
Restrictions on size and breed are very common in lease agreements. That depends where you live in, i suppose… if there are so many ‘no allowed pets’ apartments, then it must be much difficult for pet owners to find a new place… not everyone can afford a house (not an apartment). Odors or damaged, dirty feeders can also be a concern if the community has strict appearance guidelines covering garden fixtures or yard. Fish are also allowed in all university housing.
