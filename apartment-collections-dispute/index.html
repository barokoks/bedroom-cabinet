Example Of Letter Disputing Apartment Charges * Invoice From simpleinvoice17.net
I am assuming you are saying your old landlord has made a claim that you owe money for past rent that was unpaid or damages. The collector, at this time, does not have to validate the debt or provide you any documents, but at least they are on notice of the dispute, and must notify any credit reporting agency they communicate to. Report the debt collector to authorities; Don’t explain the situation (they won’t care), just dispute the collection as not mine, which is technically true (you would have paid had you known).
