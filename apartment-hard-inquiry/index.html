If the apartment manager notes the company�s intention to conduct a hard inquiry, ask if the company will accept a copy of your credit report that you pulled and printed out yourself. A hard credit pull sometimes damages a credit score by up to five points for each application submitted. Hard inquiries specifically refer to instances when a lender accesses your credit report for the purpose of evaluating you as a borrower. In this case, the credit reporting agency will note the check on your credit report.
