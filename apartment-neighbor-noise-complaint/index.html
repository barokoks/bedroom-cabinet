[Download 36&#43;] Sample Letter Of Noise Complaint To Landlord From sistarara.blogspot.com
When filing a noise complaint with your apartment complex, make sure you’ve gone over your lease before submitting your complaint to be clear on your rights and available options. Noise is common in apartments —you just need to determine if the noise is a rule violation or not. Excessive noise is usually reoccurring and not part of “ normal ” living — like constant loud music or a dog that won’t stop barking. It isn’t going to be quiet all of the time.
