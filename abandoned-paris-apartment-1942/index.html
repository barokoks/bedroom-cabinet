Good Bones for an Apartment in Paris From messynessychic.com
In 1942, a young parisian woman fearing nazi persecution fled to southern france, leaving behind a lavish apartment in paris that she would never return to. Eerie new images have emerged of a french apartment abandoned at the outbreak of world war ii and left untouched in the seven decades. She kept her apartment in paris on the right bank near the opéra garnier, though, in case she wanted to return. In 1939, a parisian apartment was locked up and abandoned.
